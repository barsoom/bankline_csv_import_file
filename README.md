# Bankline CSV import file

Generate Bankline CSV import files per <https://www.business.rbs.co.uk/content/dam/rbs_co_uk/Business_and_Content/PDFs/Bankline/Bankline-import-file-guide-CSV-RBS.pdf>, used e.g. by NatWest.

Not intended to be a complete implementation. We have implemented what we need; feel free to make PRs for further behaviour.

USER BEWARE: At the time of writing, we have not yet verified that the produced file works.
